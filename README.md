 # Loan Portfolio Automation
This application automates the process during a loan portfolio analysis using built-in python functions and libraries
 
 ## Examples and Sample Code
 - Integer and dictionary lists used to retrieve data elements and calculate averages using sum() and len()
 - The calculate_present_value() function calculates present value using the formula `Present Value = Future Value / (1 + Discounted Rate/12)**Remaining Months` by providing the future_value, remaining_months, and annual_discount_rate
 - Conditional statements are then used to find and output the most inexpensive loans equal or less than a defined amount into a tab delimited .csv file using the CSV library.
 
 ## Usage
 Once you have downloaded the source files then the program can be run by issuing the following command:
 ```python
 python GitHub_Upload/loan_analyzer.py
 ```
