 ## Examples and Sample Code
 The python code contained within loan_analyzer contains example code on how to use several types of lists containing integers and dictionaries
 to retrieve data elements and calculate averages using built-in functions such as sum() and len().  The program also shows how to calculate
 the present_value using the formula Present Value = Future Value / (1 + Discounted Rate/12)**Remaining Months from a provided list.  This calculation is then
 moved into it's own function for reusuability purposes. The program also runs through a set conditional statements to find and output the data containing the most 
 inexpensive loans into a tab delimited .csv file.  The code is all part of the module 1 challenge assignment within the Fintech Bootcamp.
